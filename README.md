## Abstract
The continuous expansion of the urban construction scale has recently contributed to the demand for the dynamics of traffic intersections that are managed, making adaptive modellings become a hot topic. Existing deep learning methods are powerful to fit complex heterogeneous graphs. However, they still have drawbacks, which can be roughly classified into two categories, 1) spatiotemporal async-modelling approaches separately consider temporal and spatial dependencies, resulting in weak generalization and large instability while aggregating; 2) spatiotemporal sync-modelling is hard to capture long-term temporal dependencies because of the local receptive field. In order to overcome above challenges, a Combined Dynamic Virtual spatiotemporal Graph Mapping (CDVGM) is proposed in this work. The contributions are the following: 1) a dynamic virtual graph Laplacian (DV GL) is designed, which considers both the spatial signal passing and the temporal features simultaneously; 2) the Longterm Temporal Strengthen model (LT2S) for improving the stability of time series forecasting; Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDVGM has excellent performances of fast convergence speed and low resource consumption and achieves the current SOTA effect in terms of both accuracy and generalization.
